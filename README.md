![Version 0.3.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.3.2-blue
)

## Instalation

You can install the extension directly from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace by clicking [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ilmaqui.execumate). Or you can:

1. Open the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon in the Sidebar on the right side of the window.
2. Search for `ExecuMate` in the Extensions view search box.
3. Click on the Install button.

## Features

With this extension you will forget about working with VS Code Tasks. This easily allows you to create new terminals and execumate specific commands with just one click. You can delete the terminals you don't use anymore or you can edit them to better suit your necessities. You can also drag and drop them around to change their order.

Global commands are maintained between projects, while workspace commands are shared amongst each individual working on the project (and each one can create new ones).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Activating this extension will dispose any terminal running, stopped or idling. So keep that in mind!
